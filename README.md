# Void-Invasion-Game
Void Invasion is a game I made in Java using OpenGL.
It was originally a project for school. A lot of this
project was done last minute to meet my deadline, so those
parts are very inefficient. The game also tends to crash
after the third wave due to brute borce collision detecting
everything wil everything. So, you have been warned.
